Use a Public API to Create a Gallery


In this project I created a webpage that requests info from the Spotify API. The user can enter information into 
a search-box at the top of the page which will then return images of album covers that are related to the search query. The user
can search for a specific album or can get album results simply by entering an artist's name.

When the results are returned the user can then click on an image to open a lightbox which will then have more information about the album.
